# Active Context - Figma Palette Generator

## Current Work Focus
**Phase**: Real Pixel-Level Color Extraction Implementation
**Status**: Implementing true image analysis with Figma API capabilities
**Date**: Major breakthrough - discovered actual API capabilities

## BREAKTHROUGH: Real Pixel Access is Possible!

### Critical Discovery: API Capabilities Misunderstood
**Problem Resolved**: Figma plugin API DOES provide pixel-level access through:
- âœ… `figma.getImageByHash(imageHash)` - Get image object
- âœ… `image.getBytesAsync()` - Get raw image bytes
- âœ… Canvas API in UI - Decode and analyze pixels
- âœ… Real color extraction from actual image data

### New Direction: Hybrid Image + Color Theory Approach
**Final Approach**: Combine real image analysis with intelligent color theory
1. **Input Method**: Select image in Figma â†’ Extract real pixel data
2. **Primary Selection**: Smart algorithm identifies best primary candidates from image
3. **Secondary/Tertiary Generation**: Color theory relationships that reference back to image colors
4. **Visual Connection**: Maintains moodboard-to-palette workflow
5. **Value Proposition**: "Extract real colors from your images and build complete design systems"

### Technical Approach Validated
1. **Color Space**: HSL for predictable tint/shade generation
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG contrast checking as toggleable feature
3. **Performance**: Complete workflow under 2 minutes
4. **Canvas Integration**: Direct output to Figma canvas with organized layout

### User Experience Principles Established
1. **Structured Layout**: Main color scales on top, harmony palettes below
2. **Clear Naming**: Descriptive, plain language for all generated elements
3. **Auto-Spacing**: Professional appearance with consistent margins
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time progress and visual results

## Current Status
- âœ… Project scope and requirements defined
- âœ… Memory bank structure created
- âœ… Development environment setup completed
- âœ… Basic plugin structure implemented
- âœ… **BREAKTHROUGH**: Real pixel access capabilities discovered
- âœ… **FINAL APPROACH**: Hybrid image + color theory validated
- ðŸ”„ Ready for real pixel-level color extraction implementation

## Next Steps: Real Pixel Extraction Implementation

### Immediate Actions Needed (Chunked for Usage Limits)
1. **Task 1**: Implement `getImageByHash` and `getBytesAsync` in backend
2. **Task 2**: Add image bytes transfer to UI via postMessage
3. **Task 3**: Create canvas-based pixel analysis in UI
4. **Task 4**: Implement proper median cut algorithm on real pixel data
5. **Task 5**: Build smart primary color selection from extracted colors
6. **Task 6**: Create hybrid secondary/tertiary generation (color theory + image colors)
7. **Task 7**: Update UI to show extracted colors for user selection
8. **Task 8**: Integrate with existing palette generation system

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **Build System**: Choose between Webpack and Vite for development
2. **Color Libraries**: Select specific libraries for color manipulation
3. **Testing Strategy**: Define testing approach and framework setup
4. **Performance Optimization**: Plan for meeting 2-minute workflow requirement

### Design Decisions to Validate
1. **Frame Layout**: Confirm exact spacing and organization structure
2. **Color Naming Convention**: Finalize naming scheme for generated elements
3. **Harmony Types**: Confirm which harmony combinations to include
4. **Accessibility Features**: Define specific WCAG compliance levels

## Active Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Image processing efficiency for multiple images
- Color calculation algorithms for large palettes
- Canvas rendering optimization for smooth output

### User Experience Refinement
- Progress indicators during processing
- Error handling and user feedback
- Settings persistence and customization

### Technical Architecture
- Modular structure for maintainability
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Testing strategy for reliable functionality

## Key Requirements Confirmed
1. **Image Selection**: User selects image in Figma (single image workflow)
2. **Real Color Extraction**: Extract actual dominant colors from image pixels
3. **Primary Selection**: Smart algorithm identifies best primary candidates
4. **Hybrid Generation**: Secondary/tertiary based on color theory + image colors
5. **Visual Connection**: Maintain moodboard-to-palette workflow
6. **Complete Design System**: Generate full palette with scales and harmonies

## Questions for Clarification
1. **Primary Selection Criteria**: What makes a color a good "primary" candidate?
2. **Color Harmony Balance**: How much weight should image colors vs. color theory have?
3. **User Control**: Should users be able to override algorithm-selected primaries?
4. **Performance**: Acceptable processing time for pixel analysis?
