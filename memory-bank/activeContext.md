# Active Context - Figma Palette Generator

## Current Work Focus
**Phase**: Project Planning & Memory Bank Creation
**Status**: Memory bank structure established, ready for development planning

## Recent Decisions & Clarifications

### Core Functionality Confirmed
1. **Input Method**: Selected frame containing bitmap images (max 10 recommended)
2. **Processing Algorithm**: Median cut algorithm with size-based weighting
3. **Color Scale System**: Material Design-inspired 000-900 scale (9 steps default, configurable 5-13)
4. **Output Structure**: Organized frames with auto-spacing and plain language naming
5. **Harmony Generation**: Auto-generated side-by-side comparisons for immediate visual feedback

### Technical Approach Validated
1. **Color Space**: HSL for predictable tint/shade generation
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG contrast checking as toggleable feature
3. **Performance**: Complete workflow under 2 minutes
4. **Canvas Integration**: Direct output to Figma canvas with organized layout

### User Experience Principles Established
1. **Structured Layout**: Main color scales on top, harmony palettes below
2. **Clear Naming**: Descriptive, plain language for all generated elements
3. **Auto-Spacing**: Professional appearance with consistent margins
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time progress and visual results

## Current Status
- âœ… Project scope and requirements defined
- âœ… Memory bank structure created
- âœ… Technical approach validated
- âœ… User experience principles established
- âœ… Development environment setup completed
- âœ… Basic plugin structure implemented
- ðŸ”„ Ready for core algorithm implementation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Development Environment Setup**: Initialize Figma plugin project structure
2. **Core Algorithm Implementation**: Implement median cut algorithm with weighting
3. **Color Scale Generation**: Create 000-900 scale generation system
4. **Basic UI Framework**: Set up plugin interface and controls

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **Build System**: Choose between Webpack and Vite for development
2. **Color Libraries**: Select specific libraries for color manipulation
3. **Testing Strategy**: Define testing approach and framework setup
4. **Performance Optimization**: Plan for meeting 2-minute workflow requirement

### Design Decisions to Validate
1. **Frame Layout**: Confirm exact spacing and organization structure
2. **Color Naming Convention**: Finalize naming scheme for generated elements
3. **Harmony Types**: Confirm which harmony combinations to include
4. **Accessibility Features**: Define specific WCAG compliance levels

## Active Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Image processing efficiency for multiple images
- Color calculation algorithms for large palettes
- Canvas rendering optimization for smooth output

### User Experience Refinement
- Progress indicators during processing
- Error handling and user feedback
- Settings persistence and customization

### Technical Architecture
- Modular structure for maintainability
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Testing strategy for reliable functionality

## Questions for Clarification
1. **Scale Granularity**: Should the 5-13 step range be user-configurable or preset options?
2. **Harmony Types**: Are there specific color harmony rules to prioritize?
3. **Error Handling**: How should the plugin handle invalid images or processing failures?
4. **Customization**: What level of user control is needed for generated palettes?
