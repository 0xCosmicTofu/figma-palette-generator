# Product Context - Figma Palette Generator

## Why This Project Exists
The current color palette creation workflow is fundamentally broken. Designers spend hours manually translating visual inspiration into systematic color systems, a process that is:
- **Time-consuming**: Hours of manual color abstraction and testing
- **Error-prone**: Human bias and fatigue lead to inconsistent results
- **Repetitive**: Same process repeated for every project
- **Inefficient**: Mental translation from visual to systematic is slow

## Problems It Solves
1. **Eliminates Manual Color Abstraction**: Automatically extracts colors from visual sources
2. **Standardizes Color Generation**: Creates consistent 000-900 scales for all colors
3. **Accelerates Workflow**: Reduces palette creation from hours to minutes
4. **Ensures Consistency**: Systematic approach prevents design drift
5. **Improves Accessibility**: Built-in WCAG compliance checking
6. **Enhances Creativity**: Frees designers to focus on application rather than generation

## How It Should Work
### User Workflow
1. **Setup**: User creates moodboard frame with bitmap images
2. **Selection**: User selects the frame and runs the plugin
3. **Processing**: Plugin analyzes images with size-based weighting
4. **Generation**: Creates organized color scales and harmonies
5. **Output**: Generates structured frames on canvas with auto-spacing
6. **Integration**: Colors automatically added to Figma color styles

### User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Should feel like a natural extension of Figma
- **Fast**: Complete palette generation in under 2 minutes
- **Professional**: Output should look like it was designed by hand
- **Flexible**: Configurable options without overwhelming the user
- **Educational**: Users should understand the color theory behind suggestions

## User Experience Principles
1. **Respect User Intent**: Don't override existing work or preferences
2. **Provide Immediate Feedback**: Show progress and results in real-time
3. **Maintain Quality**: Generated palettes should meet professional standards
4. **Enable Iteration**: Easy to regenerate or adjust results
5. **Integrate Seamlessly**: Works within existing Figma workflows

## Success Metrics
- **Time Savings**: 80% reduction in palette creation time
- **User Adoption**: High usage among target designer audience
- **Quality Output**: Generated palettes meet professional design standards
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless fit with existing Figma processes
